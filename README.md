This is a python code for parsing and modifying microsoft .lnk files.

Missing argparser for now, to use the tool set editcommandline = False to not make modifications
set hide = False if you dont want to hide the commandline from plainview.

The tool takes in one argument which is the .lnk file to be parsed/modified, if editcommandline = True, new .lnk file will be created with edited commandline: cmd2.lnk
